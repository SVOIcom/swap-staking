Hello there! \
SVOI dev team greets you and would like to present the results of created Decentralized Exchange for the FreeTON Community contest: \

Goal of this work is to create Decentralized Exchange based on Liquidity Pool mechanism and develop instruments, such as 
debot and [site](https://tonswap.com) for interacting with developed smart contracts.
